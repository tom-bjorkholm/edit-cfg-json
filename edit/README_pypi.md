# edit-cfg-json

There are 3 related packages for editing a `config-as-json`
configuration:

- **[edit-cfg-json](https://pypi.org/project/edit-cfg-json/)** the user
  interface agnostic core. It discovers the editable structure of a
  `config_as_json.Config` object by introspection, and owns all editing,
  validation and file handling. It is also the package a third party
  writes a new user interface backend against.

- **[edit-cfg-json-tk](https://pypi.org/project/edit-cfg-json-tk/)** a
  desktop editor based on Tkinter. It is a thin backend on top of the
  core.

- **[edit-cfg-json-textual](https://pypi.org/project/edit-cfg-json-textual/)**
  a terminal editor based on Textual. It is a thin backend on top of the
  core.

The application supplies its own `Config` object and gets a folding
editor for it, without writing any user interface code and without
describing its configuration schema a second time.

The three packages share a version number and are released together. Pick
the backend that matches how your application is used; both backends pull
in the core themselves.

## Project status

**Alpha. No API stability and no backward compatibility is offered while
this package is in Alpha.** That applies to the core and to both
backends. Public names may change without a major version bump.

Semantic versioning starts when the Alpha period ends. Until then, pin an
exact version if your build needs to be reproducible.

## What this package does

`edit-cfg-json` is the user interface agnostic core. It holds everything
that is not a widget:

- discovery of the editable structure of a `config_as_json.Config` object
  by introspection, so the application does not describe its schema twice
- the edit buffer, its per-field state, and the fold structure
- validation, by constructing a candidate configuration and running the
  application's own validators rather than by inspecting them
- loading, including making automatic changes to an old format file
  visible to the user, and saving

Install this package on its own if you are writing a new user interface
backend. If you just want an editor, install one of the backends instead;
they pull this package in.

## Main entry points

Everything a user of this package needs is re-exported from the top-level
`edit_cfg_json` package, so it can be imported directly:

````python
from edit_cfg_json import core_greeting
````

The package is still a skeleton. `core_greeting` is a placeholder that
returns a greeting naming the core and the `config-as-json` version it
found. It exists so that the build, the generated API documentation and
the test summary can be verified end to end before the real editor is
written.
