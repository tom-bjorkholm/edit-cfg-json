# edit\_cfg\_json\_tk.tk\_editor

Tkinter view of an edit model, with one editable field per member.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.tk_editor.NAME_COLUMN_WIDTH"></a>

#### NAME\_COLUMN\_WIDTH

Width in characters of the column that holds the member names.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.tk_editor.PADDING"></a>

#### PADDING

Padding in pixels around the widgets of the editor.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.tk_editor.VALIDATE_TEXT"></a>

#### VALIDATE\_TEXT

Text of the button that runs the validation of the application.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.tk_editor.SAVE_TEXT"></a>

#### SAVE\_TEXT

Text of the button that writes the output file.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.tk_editor.SAVE_AS_TEXT"></a>

#### SAVE\_AS\_TEXT

Text of the button that chooses an output file and then writes it.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.tk_editor.CLOSE_TEXT"></a>

#### CLOSE\_TEXT

Text of the button that ends the editor.

Closing writes nothing of its own. It is the "cancel" of the design, and it
is called Close because saving leaves the editor open: a button called Cancel
beside values that have already been written would read as an offer to undo
the writing, which it is not.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.tk_editor.SAVE_AS_TITLE"></a>

#### SAVE\_AS\_TITLE

Title of the dialog that asks which file to write.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.tk_editor.CONFIG_FILES"></a>

#### CONFIG\_FILES

What the dialog calls the files of the extension the application uses.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.tk_editor.ALL_FILES"></a>

#### ALL\_FILES

What the dialog calls every other file.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.tk_editor.RowWidgets"></a>

## RowWidgets Objects

```python
class RowWidgets(NamedTuple)
```

The widgets that one configuration member owns.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.tk_editor.RowWidgets.field"></a>

#### field

The field of an editable member, and None for every other member.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.tk_editor.RowWidgets.mark"></a>

#### mark

The widget that says what has happened to this member.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.tk_editor.EditorWidgets"></a>

## EditorWidgets Objects

```python
class EditorWidgets()
```

The widgets that show one edit model below one parent widget.

This is a class rather than a function because the fields have to be
kept: a `tkinter.StringVar` unsets its Tcl variable when it is collected,
and the field it belongs to would then lose both its text and the
callback that writes it into the model. Keeping them together also gives
an application that mounts these widgets in a window of its own a single
object to hold on to.

The widgets of the members are kept in the order the model reports its
rows in, which is the order they were created in. This version of the
model neither adds nor removes a row, so the two orders stay the same
one and the pairing is checked rather than assumed.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.tk_editor.EditorWidgets.__init__"></a>

#### \_\_init\_\_

```python
def __init__(parent: tkinter.Misc, model: EditModel) -> None
```

Create the label, one row per member, the verdict and the buttons.

The parent is a widget and not a window, so that the same rows can
later be mounted inside a window that an application owns itself.

**Arguments**:

- `parent` - Widget that becomes the parent of the created widgets.
- `model` - Model to show and to edit.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.tk_editor.EditorWidgets.label_text"></a>

#### label\_text

```python
@property
def label_text() -> str
```

Return the text that the label of the whole model shows.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.tk_editor.EditorWidgets.verdict_text_shown"></a>

#### verdict\_text\_shown

```python
@property
def verdict_text_shown() -> str
```

Return the text that the validation part of the editor shows.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.tk_editor.EditorWidgets.save_text_shown"></a>

#### save\_text\_shown

```python
@property
def save_text_shown() -> str
```

Return the text that the saving part of the editor shows.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.tk_editor.TkEditor"></a>

## TkEditor Objects

```python
class TkEditor()
```

Tkinter user interface backend for an edit model.

The class has the single method that `EditorBackend` asks for, and
deliberately nothing else: everything worth testing without a display
lives in the core.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.tk_editor.TkEditor.__init__"></a>

#### \_\_init\_\_

```python
def __init__() -> None
```

Create a backend that has not shown a model yet.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.tk_editor.TkEditor.run_editor"></a>

#### run\_editor

```python
def run_editor(model: EditModel) -> None
```

Show the model in a Tk window until the user closes it.

The widgets are held for as long as the window lives, because they
own the fields that the Tcl variables belong to.

**Arguments**:

- `model` - Model to show and to edit.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.tk_editor.edit"></a>

#### edit

```python
def edit(config: Config,
         *,
         in_file: Optional[PathOrStr] = None,
         out_file: Optional[PathOrStr] = None,
         policy: LoadPolicy = LoadPolicy.STRICT_THEN_DEFAULTS,
         settings: SettingsSource = Settings(),
         stderr_file: TextIO = sys.stderr) -> Optional[Config]
```

Edit one configuration in a Tk window, and return what was saved.

This is `edit_cfg_json.edit` with this package's backend filled in, for
an application that has already chosen Tkinter. Everything it does is
documented there.

**Arguments**:

- `config` - Configuration object to edit. It is never modified.
- `in_file` - File to read, or None to start from the declared defaults.
- `out_file` - File to write, or None to write the input file.
- `policy` - What to do about declared keys the input file does not hold.
- `settings` - What this application has already decided about key
  combinations and file names, or a callable that answers with it.
- `stderr_file` - Stream used for user-facing diagnostics.
  

**Returns**:

  The configuration object that was written, or None when nothing was.
  

**Raises**:

- `ConfigLoadError` - The input file cannot be opened for editing.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.key_names"></a>

# edit\_cfg\_json\_tk.key\_names

Translating a key combination into the notation that Tk binds by.

The application writes its key combinations once, in the notation that
`edit_cfg_json.ActionSettings` documents, and each backend translates them
into whatever its own toolkit binds by. Tk needs a translation whatever
notation is chosen, because `<Control-Shift-S>` is a form that no other
toolkit shares.

A combination this module does not know leaves that action without that key
rather than without an editor: every action of this backend has a button as
well.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.key_names.MODIFIERS"></a>

#### MODIFIERS

What Tk calls each modifier that a combination can name.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.key_names.KEY_NAMES"></a>

#### KEY\_NAMES

What Tk calls each named key, where the two notations differ.

The keys of this mapping are the names that `ActionSettings` documents, and
the values are the keysyms of Tk. The two of them agree about nothing but
`Tab`, which is in here anyway so that the mapping answers for every name
the notation has rather than for the ones that happen to differ.

<a id="edit_cfg_json_tk.key_names.tk_sequence"></a>

#### tk\_sequence

```python
def tk_sequence(combination: str) -> Optional[str]
```

Return one key combination as the event sequence that Tk binds by.

**Arguments**:

- `combination` - One key combination, as `ActionSettings` writes them.
  

**Returns**:

  The Tk event sequence of that combination, or None when it names a
  modifier or a key that this module does not know. None is not an
- `error` - the action it belongs to keeps its button and loses only
  this way of reaching it.
