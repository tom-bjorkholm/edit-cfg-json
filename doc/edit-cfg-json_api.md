# edit\_cfg\_json.backend

The protocol that every user interface backend implements.

<a id="edit_cfg_json.backend.EditorBackend"></a>

## EditorBackend Objects

```python
class EditorBackend(Protocol)
```

Show one edit model to the user and return when the user is done.

The protocol is phrased against the model and not against a convenience
wrapper, so that an application that already runs its own event loop can
build the model itself and mount the backend as a widget. The outcome of
the session is read from the model afterwards rather than returned here,
so that the protocol does not have to change when saving is added.

<a id="edit_cfg_json.backend.EditorBackend.run_editor"></a>

#### run\_editor

```python
def run_editor(model: EditModel) -> None
```

Run the user interface for one model until the user is done.

**Arguments**:

- `model` - Model to show. The backend reads and edits the model, and
  never touches the caller's configuration object.

<a id="edit_cfg_json.model_text"></a>

# edit\_cfg\_json.model\_text

Plain text rendering of an edit model and of its individual values.

<a id="edit_cfg_json.model_text.NOT_EDITABLE_FORM"></a>

#### NOT\_EDITABLE\_FORM

Form of the value text of a member this version cannot edit.

<a id="edit_cfg_json.model_text.row_value_text"></a>

#### row\_value\_text

```python
def row_value_text(row: MemberRow) -> str
```

Return the value of one member as the text a field would show.

A scalar is rendered as JSON, so that the user sees exactly what will
land in the configuration file. A member that this version of the model
cannot edit is named by its JSON kind instead of by its value, because
a list or a dict needs more than one field.

**Arguments**:

- `row` - Member to render.
  

**Returns**:

  The value text of one member.

<a id="edit_cfg_json.model_text.model_as_text"></a>

#### model\_as\_text

```python
def model_as_text(model: EditModel) -> str
```

Return the whole model as one text line per configuration member.

This is the rendering used by the examples and by the tests, so that
every step of the editor can be observed without a display. It belongs
to the core rather than to a backend because it is user interface
agnostic.

**Arguments**:

- `model` - Model to render.
  

**Returns**:

  One line per member, without a trailing line break.

<a id="edit_cfg_json.edit_model"></a>

# edit\_cfg\_json.edit\_model

The user interface agnostic model of one editable configuration.

<a id="edit_cfg_json.edit_model.MemberRow"></a>

## MemberRow Objects

```python
class MemberRow(NamedTuple)
```

One configuration member as it appears in the JSON file.

<a id="edit_cfg_json.edit_model.MemberRow.name"></a>

#### name

Name of the configuration member.

<a id="edit_cfg_json.edit_model.MemberRow.value"></a>

#### value

Value of the member in JSON space, as it is written to the file.

<a id="edit_cfg_json.edit_model.MemberRow.editable"></a>

#### editable

```python
@property
def editable() -> bool
```

Return whether this member is a scalar that can be edited.

A list or a dict value is ordinary JSON structure that needs a tree
of fields rather than a single field, which this version of the
model does not have. Such a member is still reported as a row, so
that no configuration member can silently go missing.

<a id="edit_cfg_json.edit_model.EditModel"></a>

## EditModel Objects

```python
class EditModel()
```

The editable state of one `config_as_json.Config` object.

The model does no input or output of its own and owns no event loop, so
a backend can either be run by a convenience wrapper or be mounted as a
widget by an application that already runs its own event loop.

Values are held in JSON space, that is as they are written to the
configuration file, so that an enum member is shown by its name and a
value being typed does not have to be a valid Python value yet.

This version of the model handles scalar members only. A member whose
value is a list or a dict is reported as a row that is not editable.

<a id="edit_cfg_json.edit_model.EditModel.__init__"></a>

#### \_\_init\_\_

```python
def __init__(config: Config, stderr_file: TextIO = sys.stderr) -> None
```

Read the JSON space values of one configuration object.

The object is deep copied before it is serialized, because
`Config.as_json_string()` validates, and a member validator returns
the value that is stored back into the member. Serializing the
caller's object directly could therefore change it, and the editor
never mutates the caller's configuration object.

**Arguments**:

- `config` - Configuration object to edit. It is the source of both
  the member names and their values, and is not modified.
- `stderr_file` - Stream used for user-facing diagnostics.
  

**Raises**:

- `InvalidConfiguration` - The configuration object is not valid.
- `InvalidConfigurationValue` - A member of the configuration object
  does not hold a valid value.

<a id="edit_cfg_json.edit_model.EditModel.config_type_name"></a>

#### config\_type\_name

```python
@property
def config_type_name() -> str
```

Return the class name of the edited configuration object.

<a id="edit_cfg_json.edit_model.EditModel.rows"></a>

#### rows

```python
@property
def rows() -> Sequence[MemberRow]
```

Return one row per configuration member, in file order.

File order is sorted by member name, because that is how
`config_as_json` writes the file the user edits.
