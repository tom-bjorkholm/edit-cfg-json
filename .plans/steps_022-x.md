# Delivering the remaining scope in small steps

## Where everything is

Steps 1 to 21 are implemented and committed. Steps 1 to 9 are written up in
[steps_001-009_done.md](steps_001-009_done.md) and steps 10 to 21 in
[steps_010-021.md](steps_010-021.md). The steps still to build are in
[steps_022-x.md](steps_022-x.md). Where any of the three files mentions a
design decision, [`doc/design.md`](../doc/design.md) remains the authority and
the plan says only *when* that decision gets built.

- [The decisions the plan is built on][dec] — the seven settled before the
  first step, from example observability to per-step verification.
- [The names introduced in steps 1 to 9][names] — one table of every public
  core name and the step that settled it.
- [Step 1][s1] — the walking skeleton: `EditModel`, `EditorBackend`,
  `model_as_text` and `--ui dump`, both backends showing a flat config
  read-only.
- [Step 2][s2] — the buffer became writable, with dirty tracking, and
  `--set` standing in for a user typing.
- [Step 3][s3] — validation of the buffer, the refusals it catches, and the
  mark for a value a validator rewrote.
- [Step 3B][s3b] — `Enum` and `IntEnum` members, which needed no change to
  the core at all.
- [Step 4][s4] — loading: `LoadPolicy`, `load_config`, the three distinct
  refusals, and the mark for a member a permissive load filled in.
- [Step 5][s5] — saving and `edit()`, which reached milestone 1: a save
  validates, moves the baseline it is compared against, and asks for a
  destination when it has none.
- [Step 6][s6] — descriptions and docstrings, the explain toggle in the
  model, a scrolling body in both backends, and the `Emphasis` vocabulary.
- [Step 7][s7] — field-level diagnostics: a refusal is shown at the member
  it is about, on validation and on focus loss.
- [Step 7B][s7b] — three ready-to-run programs, one per package, opening any
  `Config` class named by `--module` or `--file`, with an exit code for each
  way of refusing.
- [Step 8][s8] — automatic-change visibility: what reading an old-format
  file altered, marked at the member and reported by key.
- [Step 9][s9] — the explicit loader: `ConfigLoader`, `derived_loader`, and
  a save that refuses a file the loader would not read back as the same
  class.
- [Step 10][s10] — lists and dicts as a tree of rows with a field at every
  value, folding, and the rows being built again when a validator changes how
  many of them there are.
- [Step 11][s11] — a nested `Config` object as a node with a class, a
  docstring and members of its own, and the ownership of everything inside it.
- [Step 12][s12] — every nested object asked whether it is a configuration on
  its own, which both puts a badge on its row and names the member inside it
  that a validator refused.
- [Step 13][s13] — a list of configuration objects and a dict of them, one
  description reaching every one of them, and the confirmation that step 11 had
  already built the mechanism.
- [Step 14][s14] — how many things a member holds, where a new element is
  copied from, and the containers that say why they cannot be given one.
- [Step 15][s15] — closing an editor that holds something unsaved asks first,
  in words the core owns and in a dialog or a screen that each backend puts.
- [Step 15B][s15b] — the two interactive editors described as the product they
  are, and `--ui dump` as the very limited non-interactive user interface it
  is.
- [Step 16][s16] — the file that a save writes over kept under the name the
  application chose, once per destination per session, and a question before
  it happens.
- [Step 16B][s16b] — the name `edit-cfg-json` freed for the editor it
  promises, and the backend that prints once reached as the small utility it
  is.
- [Step 17][s17] — every document rewritten against what was actually built,
  the order of the work taken out of all of them but this one, and the release
  readiness of the three packages checked rather than assumed.
- [Step 18][s18] — the editor mounted in a window an application already owns,
  in both toolkits, with its keys reaching the editor and nothing else.
- [Step 18B][s18b] — one call per shape per toolkit, taking the keywords of
  `edit()`, and four examples where there were two.
- [Step 19][s19] — the settings of the editor as a configuration class of
  their own, editable in the editor, declarable inside an application's own
  configuration, and looked for in five places by each program.
- [Step 20][s20] — the command line of a program saying what to edit and which
  files and never how the editor behaves, which is the whole of the answer once
  every setting can be written in a file.
- [Step 21][s21] — `--version` on all three programs, as a fourth thing a run
  does instead of editing, answered by one version reporter per distribution.

## 1. How this plan is meant to be used

This document turns section 11 of [`doc/design.md`](../doc/design.md) into an
ordered list of small, individually reviewable and individually
committable steps. It is a delivery plan, not a design document: where it
mentions a design decision, `doc/design.md` remains the authority and this
file only says *when* that decision gets built.

- One step is one branch-less unit of work on `master`: implement, verify,
  ask for review, commit. The next step does not start until the previous
  one is committed.
- Every step changes what an example program does. If a step cannot be
  observed from `examples/src/example/` with `--ui tk` or `--ui textual`,
  it is the wrong step boundary and should be merged into a neighbour or
  split differently.
- Every step touches all three packages where the capability is
  user-visible, so `edit_cfg_json`, `edit_cfg_json_tk` and
  `edit_cfg_json_textual` never drift apart by more than one review.
- Steps 1 to 21 are built, and each is written up in
  [steps_001-009_done.md](steps_001-009_done.md) or in
  [steps_010-021.md](steps_010-021.md) as what it decided, what it found
  while building it and what came of its review. Steps 22 onwards are named
  steps with their observable outcome and their main risks; they are detailed
  just before they are started, when the core API is real rather than
  imagined.

### 1.1 Definition of done for one step

A step is finished when all of the following hold.

1. A short design summary was posted before editing, per `CLAUDE.md`.
2. Code, tests and example changes are all in place.
3. `./run_clean_build.py python3.12`, then `./run_clean_build.py
   python3.13`, then `./run_clean_build.py python3.14` each exit 0.
   They run sequentially; there is one `./venv` and the three cannot be
   run in parallel.
4. For each of those three runs, `./reports/index.html` says
   `Build succeeded` with no errors or warnings, and
   `./reports/mypy_errors.txt`, `./reports/flake8_log.txt`,
   `./reports/python_layout_log.txt` and `./reports/pytest_log.txt` are
   clean. Every issue the tools report anywhere in the repository is
   fixed, not triaged as unrelated.
5. A summary of the changes and of any oddities noticed is written up.
6. The step is reviewed and committed.

Note that the last of the three builds leaves `./venv` on that Python
version. Record which one, because the next step's fast iteration with
`./run_static_checks.py` and targeted `pytest` runs uses that venv.

## 2. Milestones

| Milestone | Steps | What exists at the end | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M1 Flat round trip | 1 to 5 | Both backends edit a `Config` with one `str` and one `int`, validate it and save it | done |
| M2 Flat, fully explained | 6 to 9 | Descriptions, docstrings, field-level diagnostics, automatic-change visibility, explicit loader | done |
| M3 Structure and folding | 10 to 12 | Lists, dicts, nested `Config` objects, folding with per-subtree badges | done |
| M4 Configs in containers | 13 to 14 | `LIST_ELEMENT` and `DICT_VALUE` nesting, adding and removing elements | done |
| M5 Release readiness | 15 to 17 | Closing keeps what was not saved, files are not overwritten unannounced, and first release is documented, classified and published | done |
| First release 0.0.2 | release on PyPI.org | [https://pypi.org/project/edit-cfg-json/](https://pypi.org/project/edit-cfg-json/) | done |

## 3. Steps 22 onwards, as named steps

Each of these is detailed just before it is started. What is fixed now is
the order, the observable outcome and the main risk.

### Step 22 - Add and remove omitted members

A member that a class omits from JSON while it holds no object shall also
be possible to add and remove in the editor. Exactly how to achieve this
is the subject of a design investigation in the beginning of this step.

### Step 23 - Full support for `DICT_VALUE_BY_KEY`

Add full support for adding and deleting values in a dict that are
declared by `DICT_VALUE_BY_KEY`.

### Step 24 - Better bool support

When the user enters a bool value they should get the same support as
when entering an enum value. The text in the text field should be
compared to `true` and `false` in a case insensitive way and if the
text in the field matches the beginning of `true` or `false` it should
be expanded to that value.

### Step 25 — The program asks for what the command line left out

A wizard: the program opens with no location, no class name and no files,
and asks for them in the toolkit it was started in. What has been chosen,
what is still missing and whether the class could be loaded is state, and by
the lesson of step 6 about the explanation toggle it belongs in the core so
that the two backends cannot drift about it. Each backend then contributes a
dialog or a screen, and a file chooser, which is where the two toolkits
differ most and where neither has a headless test that is worth much. 

When we get here investigate if using
[https://pypi.org/project/wizard-ui-bridge/](https://pypi.org/project/wizard-ui-bridge/)
and
[https://pypi.org/project/wizard-tk-bridge/](https://pypi.org/project/wizard-tk-bridge/)
makes implementing the wizards simpler.

Alternatively, consider if we should use the menubar and menu items like
File - Open. (Using the menubar may feel very natural in the Tk version.)

## 4. Open questions recorded, not answered

These do not block current development, and each is scheduled to be answered at the
step that needs it. They are listed here so they are not forgotten.
